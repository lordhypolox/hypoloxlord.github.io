REFLECTION

In this quarter, I realized that there are many ways to code certain elements and how to use more CSS properties. I learned that in different programming languages, there are multiple ways to do the edit certain attributes of an element and learn more ways to design my website. I also learned that there is so much work needed to put in creating websites, by simply its layout, structure, to its design, interactivity, and attractiveness.

I also learned that we have to manage our time more properly for the activities done face-to-face. Because of the shortened classes, I realized that we have to be efficient when it comes to finishing activities quickly enough to fit inside the 45-minute time limit. I also learned that in this quarter, self-learning is incredibly important. Because of the shortened classes, we aren't able to properly discuss lessons without the time cutting off the explanations, or simply rushing the discussion.
