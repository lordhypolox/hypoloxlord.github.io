						In this quarter, I have learned many new lessons and experienced new challenges. For example, I have learned that you should practice before the actual performance in ICT hands-on activities. I also learned this quarter that you should do activities by dividing the work over time instead of doing it all in a short amount of time. I also learned that a lot of challenges can be easily finished by helping one another, as friends can make it more fun and helps you understand topics more by talking to one another.
						<br> <br>
						I would like to thank my classmates, teachers, family, and friends for joining me in this journey, for helping me when I am confused, and learning new things with them. I cherish these moments with everyone in this school and outside of it. I thank everyone for this moment with you, as we wouldn't get this far without you.
