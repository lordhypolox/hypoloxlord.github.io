This whole school year made me close to people who helped me realize my wrongs, even mended my relationships with people and made me open up to my family again. Somehow, the people in Family made me realize the little things. I grew up exposed to knowledge of the world too fast, asking questions wherein I didn't need to know the answers to. But my friends helped me realize that not all questions need answers, as long as in your heart you know who you are. </div> <br/> <br/> <br/ <br/> <div id='a'> <a href='HOMEhtml.html' style='color:pink;'> return </a> ")
